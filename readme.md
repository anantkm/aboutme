<div style="text-align: justify"> This page was created to showcase all the projects associated with the courses completed during my masters. This page serves as a index to all the projects that are hosted on the GitHub. Feel free to fork this project to customise :)


Even though I chose the courses according to my wish, I can broadly classify them based on 3 categories.

    <td>1.Implementing Connected Component Algorithm<br>In this project, I learned basic operations like adjusting brightness, the contrast of the image and other basic operations of image processing. Mainly this project taught how to implement Iso-data intensity thresholding, generating a binary image from a given image and performing connected component analysis on the image. <br>Links: <a href="https://github.com/anantkm/COMP9517/tree/main/ConnectedComponent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Source Code</a> | <a href="https://github.com/anantkm/COMP9517/blob/main/ConnectedComponent/Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Report</a>.<br><br><br>2.Classification of Ara and Tobacco Plants <br>I used HSV colourspace to extract the green part of the plant, I used SIFT and HOG algorithms to extract features and an SVM Classifier to classify the plants. Precision, Recall and ROC were used to evaluate the results. You could read about the techiques and code here.<br>Links:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/anantkm/COMP9517/tree/main/PlantClassification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Report</a>.<br><br><br>Detection and Segmentation of Ara and Tobacco Plants - Group Project<br>There were 3 tasks in this project. Task 1 - To detect the plants in the image, Task 2- creating a binary image of the plant, Task 3- Multi-instance segmentation. I worked on Task 3. <br>Links: <a href="https://github.com/HenryLiangzy/COMP9517_Group" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Source Code</a> | <a href="https://github.com/anantkm/COMP9517/blob/main/GroupProject/COMP9517_Group_Project_Result.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Report</a>.</td>

    <td>1. Japanese character recognition <br><br>Implemented various Neural Networks to solve this problem. Experimented with various hyperparameters influence on each network. The results can be found in the report.  <br>Links: <a href="https://github.com/anantkm/JapaneseCharacterRecognition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Source Code</a> | <a href="https://github.com/anantkm/JapaneseCharacterRecognition/blob/master/hw1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Report</a>.<br><br><br>2. Predicting the product review of products sold on Amazon. <br>With all the constraints in place, implemented text preprocessing methods. Used LSTM with the linear nural network model and a regularizer tnn.dropout to design the network.<br>Links: <a href="https://github.com/anantkm/productReviewPrediction/blob/main/student.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Source Code</a></td>

    <td>1. Collision Counting LSH (C2LSH) Algorithm <br>Implemented C2LSH algorithm in PySpark without using any inbuilt functions. The implementation was one of the fastest in the class of 300. <br>Links: <a href="https://github.com/anantkm/COMP9313/blob/main/C2LSH/submission.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Source Code</a> | <a href="https://github.com/anantkm/COMP9313/blob/main/C2LSH/report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Report</a>.<br><br>2.

Text classification to predict the most relevant news articles for 10 Topic.<br>Used Bag of words to construct the feature vector. Evaluated Precision, Recall and F1 score of each Machine Learning Model. Also, used SMOT technique to handle the imbalance in the data. <br>Links: <a href="https://github.com/anantkm/COMP9417/tree/main/ArticleClassifier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Source Code</a> | <a href="https://github.com/anantkm/COMP9417/blob/main/ArticleClassifier/Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Report</a>.</td>

    <td>Revenue and Rating prediction of Movie dataset. <br>Implemented 2 different models to predict Revenue and Rating. Considering the length of the feature vector was large, tried feature reduction techniques. However, given the environment, it was taking a long time to train on UNSW CSE Machine. Hence had to let go of the method. <br><br>Links: <a href="https://github.com/anantkm/RatingandReviewPrediction/blob/main/z5277610.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Source Code</a> | <a href="https://github.com/anantkm/RatingandReviewPrediction/blob/main/z5277610.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Report</a>.</td>
