<div style="text-align: justify"> This page was created to showcase all the projects associated with the courses completed during my masters. This page serves as a index to all the projects that are hosted on the GitHub. Feel free to fork this project to customise :)


Even though I chose the courses according to my wish, I can broadly classify them based on 3 categories.

Due to its widespread use as filler text for layouts, non-readability is of great importance: human perception is tuned to recognize certain patterns and repetitions in texts. If the distribution of letters and 'words' is random, the reader will not be distracted from making a neutral judgement on the visual impact and readability of the typefaces (typography), or the distribution of text on the page (layout or type area). For this reason, dummy text usually consists of a more or less random series of words or syllables. This prevents repetitive patterns from impairing the overall visual impression and facilitates the comparison of different typefaces. Furthermore,      |
