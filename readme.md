<div style="text-align: justify"> This page was created to showcase all the projects associated with the courses completed during my masters. This page serves as a index to all the projects that are hosted on the GitHub. Feel free to fork this project to customise :)


Even though I chose the courses according to my wish, I can broadly classify them based on 3 categories.

| Computer Vision                   	| COMP9517    	| There were 2 projects in this course - Individual and Group Project.  Individual Project: In this project, I learned basic operations like adjusting brightness, the contrast of the image and other basic operations of image processing. Mainly this project taught how to implement Iso-data intensity thresholding, generating a binary image from a given image and performing connected component analysis on the image.  Group project: There were 2 parts to this project. One part had to be completed individually and the other was a group. 1. Individual: The task of this project was to implement the classification of plants Ara and Tobacco. I used HSV colourspace to extract the green part of the plant, I used SIFT and HOG algorithms to extract features and an SVM Classifier to classify the plants. Precision, Recall and ROC were used to evaluate the results. You could read about the techiques and code here. 2. Group: There were 3 tasks in this project. Task 1 - To detect the plants in the image, Task 2- creating a binary image of the plant, Task 3- Multi-instance segmentation. I worked on Task 3.
